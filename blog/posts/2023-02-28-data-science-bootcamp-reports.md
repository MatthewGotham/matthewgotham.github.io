### Data Science Bootcamp Reports

Here are some explaratory data analyses that I wrote for my <a href="https://blog.hyperiondev.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Data-Science-Syllabus-DfE.pdf">skills bootcamp in data science</a>, funded by the Department for Education and run by HyperionDev/Imperial College London:

- An <a href="./automobile_EDA.pdf">analysis</a> of data from Ward's Automotive Yearbook 1985 (available from Kaggle <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/toramky/automobile-dataset">here</a>).
- An <a href="./E&W_death_rates_EDA.pdf">analysis</a> of death rates in England and Wales from 1841 to 2020.

I completed the course in February 2023. You can view my portfolio <a href="https://www.hyperiondev.com/portfolio/103618/">here</a>.
